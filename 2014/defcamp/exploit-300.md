An IP address 10.13.37.33 is provided. I guess people had trouble figuring out what to do here because eventually they threw out a hint "gitlist". Navigating to http://10.13.37.33/gitlist showed a redis repository.

It turns out gitlist is vulnerable to remote command execution, and an exploit was readily available at [http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/33929/](http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/33929/). I downloaded it and executed it:

```
# python 33929.py http://10.13.37.33/gitlist/redis /var/ww/git/cache
[!] Using cache location /var/ww/git/cache
[!] Shell dropped; go hit http://10.13.37.33/gitlist/cache/x.php?cmd=ls
```

We supposedly have remote command execution now, so I tried it by passing the id command:

Yep, it worked! I used this to enumerate the target and eventually found some interesting files in the / directory:

e3.flag looked promising. Opening it up revealed the flag for this challenge:

The flag is **stupid psychopathic git**
