> Your father has been known to use the titles of his favorite books as passwords. While you don't remember any of the names of the books, your father keeps a poster for one of them on his wall. Can you figure out the name of the book and unlock the CD?

Either you could upload the poster on <a href="https://images.google.com/">Google Image Search Engine</a> or <a href="https://www.tineye.com/">Tineye Reverse Image Search</a>, the results provide you the cover of the book with the title which is your flag.

The flag is **POSITRONIC MAN**
